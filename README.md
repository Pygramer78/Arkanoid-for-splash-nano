# Arkanoid-for-splash-nano
Hey everyone, and welcome to my repository. Here, i made a program that you can load into the arduino nano
that's inside of the splash nano, a 'console' i just created by myself. It consists on 1 arduino nano, 1x 1088AS, 3x buttons, 1x switch or interruptor and a buzzer.
The first game to ever exist on it is this one, which is the only one i created so far. I will try to make a tetris, with/without music, and when i have more time,
i'll just tune it, even tho i took 4 days to create the first one (1st day was research, 2nd was programming this, 3rd testing and debugging and finally, on day 4th, i finished it by welding all the things
together.). I'll just take some rest and develop more recreations of games. This one is like arkanoid, but it's not the same, since in arkanoid, there are blocks that you break, but so far, i just made
the player and a bouncing ball.
